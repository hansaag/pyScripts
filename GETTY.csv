*** EXCLUSIVE - VIDEO AVAILABLE ***


WARRENSBURG, MO - MARCH 21: Gabi Shull at her ballet studio on March 21, 2016 in Warrensburg, Missouri.

AN AMPUTEE schoolgirl who lost a leg to cancer has defied the odds to become a competitive dancer. When ballerina Gabi Shull had her leg amputated she feared she would never dance again. But thanks to groundbreaking rotationplasty surgery, the 14-year-old bone cancer survivor has been able to get back on her toes. Gabi was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in March 2011, when she was just nine-years-old. Her diseased knee was removed and her foot was rotated 180 degrees and reattached to her upper leg  with her ankle serving as her knee. Gabi was fitted with a prosthetic lower leg and took her first steps a year later. Now Gabi, from Missouri, America, can bend and flex her prosthesis by moving her foot and is now encouraging others to live their dreams and never give up.

People are weakened by vomiting and diarrhea but NGO's believe the real danger will come when the rains arrive in a few weeks time. Marcel Pelletier, a water engineer with the ICRC says, ""In my ten years' experience as a water engineer in conflict-affected areas, I would say the water shortage in Jamam is as severe as anything I've seen. It is a desperate situation. There is no excess water for washing; it is all used for cooking and drinking. People are digging by hand into the ground on the site of dried-up watering holes and scooping up any water they find. These people are thirsty and are spending six hours outside with jerry cans in the intense heat. The rains will come in about 5 weeks. Far from being the solution, the rains will actually make things worse. The lowland where animals now graze and which people have used as a toilet will flood, turning it into a vast contaminated lake. With no clean water nearby, people will drink directly from it. The health risk is glaring; deadly water related diseases could sweep through the camp like wildfire. We have a real humanitarian crisis on our hands. We only have weeks to prevent it getting worse and indeed spinning out of control""u201d.

British computing pioneer Charles Babbage's (1791-1871) Difference Engine No 1 was the first successful automatic calculator and remains one of the finest examples of precision engineering of the time. It was a decimal digital machine - the value of a number being represented by the positions of toothed wheels marked with decimal numbers. This portion here was assembled in 1832 by Babbage's engineer, Joseph Clement. It consists of about 2000 parts and represents one-seventh of the complete engine. This 'finished' portion of the unfinished engine was demonstrated to some acclaim by Babbage and functions impeccably to this day.
